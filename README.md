# Tic-Tac-Toe
This Tic Tac Toe game allows two players to play against each other on the same device, taking turns to place their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all nine squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is declared a draw.
